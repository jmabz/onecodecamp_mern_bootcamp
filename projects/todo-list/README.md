# To-do List App
This project is a simple to-do list made as part of a teaching demo for OneCodeCamp's MERN stack bootcamp, so as to deliver the topic in question simulating a webinar environment.

## Navigating the Source Code
To see how a simple web app like this can be contained as a React component, refer to `src/components/ToDoList.jsx`.

To investigaate how individual to-do list elements are rendered, refer to `src/components/ToDoItem.jsx`.

## What I can improve or add if I had more time
- Filters by task status, to further organize what is and isn't done.
- Task counters, to have a bird's-eye view on what needs to be done by the numbers.
